# In-place Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
--link--

Given a string-encoded list of 'swaps' in a sorting algorithm, this shows a visualization of the sort from start to finish.
Although it can be modified to work for out-of-place sorting algorithms, this project was initially only designed to support in-place input.
